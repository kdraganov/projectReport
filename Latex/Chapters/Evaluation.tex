\section{Results}

\subsection{Problems}
Data available, data frequency, no knowledge when buses do curtail, not taking into account bus dwell time, bus drivers who are running ahead of schedule could be driving slower on purpose and thus. Tool gives an upper bound of the of the WMA lost time per section.
