\chapter{Professional \& Ethical Issues}
%Either in a seperate section or throughout the report demonstrate that you are aware of the \textbf{Code of Conduct \& Code of Good Practice} issued by the British Computer Society and have applied their principles, where appropriate, as you carried out your project.

%Make sure we reword and improve this to include all aspects of our development process
Throughout the implementation and planning stage of the project, many considerations have been taken to abide by the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct \& Code of Practice \cite{bcsCodeOfConduct}. These rules are introduced mainly to safeguard and protect the intellectual property of individuals who would not appreciate the use of their work by others without adequate recognition. Since unique ideas or works are in great demand, care must be taken to appreciate the works of others and to clearly reference any work that we undertake. The unauthorised use of any material in the report or the code is considered unethical. In the case of this project, a software application has been built through a combination of Open-Source libraries, code found in the internet, and my own work. This has made the progress of the project substantially faster, enabling us to adapt the work of others to better suit our requirements. Every single idea, code and piece of important information has been referenced in this report as well as the code listing, and I do not claim ownership of the work performed by others. Another important consideration I have made is to ensure the program we have developed does not provide any performance or security issues to the user's computer. One of the reasons we chose Scala as the main programming language is its automatic garbage collection. We need not worry about de-allocating memory to the program once it is not needed, as Scala runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which does this for us, enabling us to focus on more important aspects of the project. Consideration was also taken to not open up any security flaws in the system, as a result of using our software.
