%Either in a seperate section or throughout the report demonstrate that you are aware of the \textbf{Code of Conduct \& Code of Good Practice} issued by the British Computer Society and have applied their principles, where appropriate, as you carried out your project.
\chapter{Professional \& Ethical Issues}
Throughout every stage of this project I have made every effort to follow the rules and guidelines that are set out by the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct \& Code of Practice \cite{bcsCodeOfConduct}. These rules and professional standards that govern the individual decisions and behaviour. The main rule that apply almost to every software development project states the individual should:
\begin{itemize}
	\item "have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and
the environment."
	\item "have due regard for the legitimate rights of Third Parties"
\end{itemize}

The whole project has been planned,designed and developed with both of these rules, as well as other rules and standards, in mind. The system makes use of a number of third party libraries and framework. However I have made explicitly the use of any such libraries and provided the according reference to the source of the original idea/product. I have also given references to any work or ides that I have made use of throughout the project.

I have also tried to make sure that the applications that were developed as part of this project do not pose any harm neither to the computers they are running on or interacting with nor to their users. The main with our tool as discussed in the previous chapter is the fact that this system is expected to run 24/7 with a large number of files being processed every day. I have also used appropriate method to safeguard the database from any SQL injection \cite{Su2006} which could potentially alter the data unintentionally or without the appropriate permission. However it should be noted that this is a prototypical system and not a fully working and security proof production version.
