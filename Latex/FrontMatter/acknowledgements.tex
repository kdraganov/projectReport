First and foremost I offer my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor Dr Steffen Zschaler for the continuous support, guidance, encouragement, insightful comments and hard questions throughout the course of this exciting project.

I would also like to thank Andrew Highfield and Keith Elliot from TFL for providing me with all the needed data, information and feedback which has been immensely helpful.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents Vladimir and Veselka also my sister Lilia and my partner Simona for their support and patience not only during the project, but throughout my life as well.
